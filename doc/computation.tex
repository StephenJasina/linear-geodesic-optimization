	\maketitle

	This document details the strategy for computing important quantities on a mesh, like curvature, as well as the loss functions based on these quantities. Furthermore, details of computing gradients of these quantities are presented.

	Due to the necessity of much more notation than in the main paper, some choices of letters will differ.
